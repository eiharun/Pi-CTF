# 400

# Creation
    Easy RSA
    PING{3Z_R$@}

Using rsa.py

Encrypted flag = [5, 156, 199, 312, 140, 266, 85, 222, 136, 82, 245, 207]


# Challenge
We recieved a list which seems to have been converted to decimal using python's ord() function.
However it is encrypted using some algorithm, we have collected the following information and nothing more
Encrypted message = [5, 156, 199, 312, 140, 266, 85, 222, 136, 82, 245, 207]
n=319
e=3
p=29
Can you decrypt the flag?
